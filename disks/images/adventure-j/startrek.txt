This version of startrek is found at http://www.vintage-basic.net/bcg/superstartrek.bas.
It is significant being the version from Dave Ahl (later in 101 BASIC games) edited by John Borders.
[Note the errant Gorders, probably the result of a poor quality scan.]

John Borders moved from Byte Shop with Paul Terrell to join Exidy Inc. at the end of 1977. 
He developed the Sorcerer ROM-resident Monitor software (equivalent of Apple ][ WozMon).
The date of John's port, March 1978, is one month prior to the Sorcerer's launch at PERCOMP '78 in April at Long Beach.
So possibly this version of Startrek was demoed at that launch. I like to think so.

The game rules are found here: https://www.atariarchives.org/basicgames/showpage.php?page=157.

I made changes so it runs under BBC BASIC for the Agon Light.
And then a few further changes so it also runs under B:MBASIC.COM in Nihirash's Agon-CPM2.2.
