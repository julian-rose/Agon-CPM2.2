To do any serious programming under CP/M, the first thing you need is a
good programmers editor. There aren't many in the archives, but I have
tried most of them and found ZDE to be the best. It is small, has lots
of features, and uses Wordstar commands which are familiar to me and
easy to learn.


    Downloading files for ZDE

The ZDE 1.6 editor can be downloaded from Bo Zimmerman's CP/M archive
here <http://zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cpm/editors/zde16.pma>. This file
is in a |.PMA| archive, so we also need the utility, pmautoae.com
<http://zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cpm/archivers/pmautoae.com>, to
uncompress it, again from Bo Zimmerman's site. These two files should be
copied onto a floppy disk or disk image if using an emulator.


    Unpacking ZDE

I am currently using an emulator which only has 8" SD disks which are
not big enough to unpack ZDE onto and contain the compressed file.
Therefore I will have the files |pmautoae.com| and |zde16.pma| on a disk
in my C: drive and will uncompress them to a blank disk in my B: drive.

|pmautoae.com| is a self-expanding archive so to expand it onto my B:
drive from the archive on my C: drive, I run:

|B> c:pmautoae
|

Then to extract the contents of the |zde16.pma| archive held on my C:
drive to the B: drive, I run:

|B> pmext c:zde16.pma b:
|

If your disks are big enough, then you can do the above all on one disk,
say the B: drive; in which case do the above, but change references to |
c:| to |b:|


    Configuring ZDE

Before the editor can be used, it needs to be configured. The most
important thing to configure is the Terminal type, which is done as follows:

|B> zdenst16 zde16
|

Select |t| to configure the terminal, then |l| to list the terminals.
Press return until your terminal is shown, then press |y| next to it. I
am using z80pack <http://www.unix4fun.org/z80pack/> so therefore choose
|ANSI standard|. Now press |ESC| then |s| to save the changes. If you
are unsure which terminal to select, try each in turn, then start ZDE to
see if it works, pressing |ESC q| to quit.

ZDE should be ready to go at this point. To read the ZDE documentation,
type the following:

|B> zde16 zde10.doc
|


      Using ZDE

The editor is started with the command |zde16| and can be run with a
filename as an argument. If a filename is supplied, the editor will try
to open it, if it doesn't exist then it will start a new file with the
name supplied. ZDE uses the Wordstar key combinations which are
explained in the ZDE documentation. On some machines the main command
key |CTRL+k| is used as a cursor key, in which case |ESC| can be used
instead. The most important commands are listed below:

Command	Purpose
ESC h	Bring up the command key help
CTRL+k q / ESC q	Quit editor without saving
CTRL+k x / ESC x	Exist and Save
CTRL+k l / ESC l	Load a new file
CTRL+k s / ESC s	Save the current file
CTRL+r	Page up
CTRL+c	Page down
CTRL+e / cursor	Line up
CTRL+x / cursor	Line down
CTRL+s / cursor	Cursor left
CTRL+d / cursor	Cursor right


ZDE is a great editor and well worth the time to learn. It has many
facilities to make life easier for the programmer and will definitely
help make your retro programming more productive.
