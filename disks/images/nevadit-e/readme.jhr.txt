This image is the Nevada Editor for CP/M 2.2.
The user reference is at: http://www.retroarchive.org/cpm/text/Nevada_EDIT_3.0_Users_Reference.pdf;
too large to fit on this disk image.
See pp:6-9 for generating the executable.
For Agon I chose '@ ANSI mode terminal', and this is the EDITANSI.COM file on this disk image.
