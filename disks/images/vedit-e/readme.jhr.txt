This disk image is VEDIT 2.33 for CP/M-80.
It is found at: http://www.retroarchive.org/cpm/text/text.htm

I have generated VPAGON.COM, configured for an ANSI terminal.
This is built using: INSTALL VPLUSZC.SET VPAGON.COM, as described in READCRT.TXT


The editor has two modes: visual and command. 

On startup by: VPAGON hello.c, it enters visual mode.
I have copied the visual mode commands summary into VEDIT COMMANDS SUMMARY.PDF 
You can find these in READCRT.TXT.
In visual mode CTRL-N toggles between insert and overwrite 
ESC-E takes you to command mode

Do 'H' in command mode for a list of command mode commands.
